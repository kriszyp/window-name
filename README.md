(Currently this package exists mainly as a proposed prototype template for DojoX packages)

This package provides a window.name implementation. This comes from DojoX, and if you wish to 
preserve the DojoX directory hierarchy, you should map or install this package with the following 
alias (in your package.json mappings or through your install script):

    "dojox/io": "http://packages.dojotoolkit.org/window-name.zip"
